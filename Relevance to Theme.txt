This project is closely associated with the "An AI Solution for Industries" project subject because it applies cutting-edge machine-learning technology to the healthcare business, with an emphasis on mental health diagnostics, management, and planning within a healthcare system. DiagnoSmart uses AI to mine and model massive volumes of historical data on mental illnesses, as well as new patterns of uptake, to deliver robust insights about future rates of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and eating disorders. The platform then uses this freed-up prediction power to direct clinical and municipal health services to take focused, data-driven actions. In effect, this is designed to promote the transition from reactive usage of health systems to a more proactive approach to decision-making.

Furthermore, by converting massive volumes of raw, and sometimes fragmented, health data into succinct and actionable insight, DiagnoSmart enables frontline healthcare workers to deliver a more efficient, accurate, and tailored care modelâ€”especially in resource-constrained circumstances. DiagnoSmart improves clinical workflows by providing real-time decision suggestions while also elevating the model of care for health systems at the population level; for example, by assisting a region in considering changing mental health service provision in an area based on expected patterns.
