Background:

DiagnoSmart is a groundbreaking AI-based platform developed to address the rising global challenge of mental health disorders—including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and eating disorders. Although mental health disorders are increasing across the globe, many under-resourced communities, especially in rural areas or congested healthcare environments, do not have access to sufficient tools or infrastructure to assess or treat individuals. Traditional mental health assessments are often slow, manual, subjective, and limited, thus widening the gap in care delivery.

Using AI for Mental Health Assessment:
With the emergence of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and machine learning, DiagnoSmart utilizes these advances to revolutionize mental health assessment practices. The DiagnoSmart AI platform uses machine-learning algorithms to evaluate structured health data gathered in clinic settings, including patient histories, symptom checklists, and past diagnoses. It also incorporates epidemiological datasets—such as age-standardized prevalence rates of mental health disorders—to train its predictive models.

DiagnoSmart converts historical and present data into predictive analytics designed to aid healthcare providers in identifying patients who may be at high risk for mental illness early on. This includes disorders like schizophrenia, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, and eating disorders, as reflected in datasets from countries such as Afghanistan.

DiagnoSmart is built to be clinic-focused: placing intelligent decision support directly into the hands of doctors and healthcare workers where it is needed most. It provides real-time analyses and recommendations that help staff optimize patient triage, efficiently prioritize care, and obtain faster and more accurate diagnoses. This real-time aspect is especially critical in busy or resource-constrained settings, where even a small delay can negatively affect patient outcomes
