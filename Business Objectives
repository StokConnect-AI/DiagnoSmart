Our project focuses on helping healthcare workers make better, faster decisions 
about mental health care by giving them clear insights from data.

•	Business Success Criteria:
DiagnoSmart should make it easier for healthcare workers to quickly identify mental 
health trends in their patients or communities and plan resources effectively. Success 
will be measured by how much it helps reduce manual data analysis, saves time, and 
supports earlier detection of at-risk patients.


•	Business Background:
Mental health is often overlooked because healthcare workers are busy and lack real-time insights.
Clinics usually depend on old reports or manual methods, which can delay action. DiagnoSmart helps
close this gap by analyzing data and showing clear, easy-to-read mental health trends. This allows 
doctors and nurses to make better decisions and plan more effective interventions.

•	Requirements, Constraints, and Risks:
	Requirements: The system needs reliable mental health prevalence data, user-friendly dashboards, 
and integration into clinical workflows.

	Constraints: It must follow patient privacy regulations, use secure data systems, and clearly state 
that it supports but does not replace professional judgment.

	Risks: Wrong predictions or misinterpretation of results could cause overreaction or missed cases. 
To reduce this risk, DiagnoSmart will include disclaimers and remind healthcare workers that its outputs
must be validated clinically.
